##### Obtain a specific instance of a data product

Download files for a single NEON data product, site, and year-month combination to obtain smaller and more specific NEON datasets. This functionality requires a product ID from step 1 or the NEON [data portal](http://data.neonscience.org/static/browse.html). Optionally, one NEON site can be selected.

An item will appear in a new folder of the form **NEON\_\<site\>\_\<time range\>**, located in the same directory containing **Calliope View**. The item is zipped and need to be put through step 2.
